# Introduction
I'm a biologist with CSIRO's Marine Resources and Industries working in the Acoustics & Pelagic Ecosystems Team. I manage the biological data within the group. This includes colating and standardising historical and new data. I learned to code at Data School. Prior to Data School I managed my data and conducted statistical analyses using Excel, Access and Systat.

# My Project
I am using Data from the 2019. This included

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
---
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(Roughy, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "my tidy data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**

```{r standard-plot, raw data }
#create a summary table
Roughy1_group <- Roughy %>% 
  group_by(year,Area_MS,sex) %>% 
  summarise(SLadj_cm_mean = mean(SLadj_cm),
            sdSL = sd(SLadj_cm, na.rm = TRUE),
            n(),
            seSL = sd(SLadj_cm) / sqrt(n())
            ) %>% 
  rename(Length = SLadj_cm_mean)

#ploting raw data with means
ggplot(data = Roughy,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = Length,
                     colour = sex)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .5, size = 1)+
    
    
  geom_line(data=Roughy1_group, size = 1
          )+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  facet_wrap(~Area_MS)
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
